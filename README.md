# 🔴 KillSwitch SaaS

**KillSwitch SaaS** is a tiny, high-leverage security micro-service that gives SaaS founders:

- A **global OFF switch** for their product  
- **Per-user freeze / unfreeze** controls  
- A full **immutable security event log**  
- A simple **enforcement API + middleware** their app can call on every request  

This is a **drop-in security control plane** for live SaaS products.
